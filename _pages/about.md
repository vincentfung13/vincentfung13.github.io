I am a Research Scientist at [ByteDance AI Lab](https://ailab.bytedance.com/), where I work on computer vision.

I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computing Science from [the University of Glasgow](gla.ac.uk) after spending 3 wonderful years in Scotland in 2016, I also obtained a bachelor's degree in Eletronics Engineer from [Sun Yat-Sen University](www.sysu.edu.cn). Prior to joining ByteDance, I was a research software engineer at [ViSenze](https://www.visenze.com/), where I worked on deep metric learning for large-scale image retrieval, I was part of the team that won the [DeepFashion2](https://sites.google.com/view/cvcreative/deepfashion2) clothes retrieval challenge in ICCV 2019. Before that, I was an algorithm team lead at [Tuputech](https://www.tuputech.com/home), where I worked on large-scale person re-identification and tracking.

Currently, my research interest lies in 3D computer vision, particularly implicit neural 3D scene representation - how to encode the complex geometry and texture of real world scenes into a neural network.
