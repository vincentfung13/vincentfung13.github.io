I am a Research Scientist at [Gaussian Robotics](https://www.gaussianrobotics.com/) in Singapore. I am currently working on various topics on intelligent robotics, such as visual SLAM related deep learning algoirthms, multi-task learning and efficient deep learning model inference on hardware. 

I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computing Science from [the University of Glasgow](https://gla.ac.uk) in 2016, after spending 3 wonderful years in Scotland, I also obtained a bachelor's degree in Eletronics Engineering from [Sun Yat-Sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn) in the same year. 

Prior to joining Gaussian Robotics, I was a research scientist at [ByteDance AI Lab](https://ailab.bytedance.com/), where I worked on 3D computer vision problems and large-scale product retrieval from video sequences. I also spent time at [ViSenze](https://www.visenze.com/) and [Tuputech](https://www.tuputech.com/home), leading various computer vision projects. 

I am interested in 3D computer vision problems, including point cloud understanding, novel view synthesis and depth estimation. My goal is to build algorithms that efficiently interact with our physical world.
